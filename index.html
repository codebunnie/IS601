    <div class="headline"> I am studying to be a Data Scientist </div>	
		<div class="contents"><p>I happen to like to analyze data, especially crash safety tests. I aspire to hopefully work as a data scientist for the <a href="http://www.iihs.org">IIHS</a>, <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov">NTSB</a>, or <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov">NHTSA.</a></p> </div>

    <div class="headline"> I've used PHP and MySQL Before... </div>	
		<div class="contents"><p>I have used PHP before, mostly via <a href="http://www.wampserver.com"> WAMP</a> but I could certainly use a refresher in it. </p> </div>

    <div class="headline"> I have NO Linux Experience... </div>	
		<div class="contents"><p>This is a huge handicap I hope to overcome in this class. Aside of  learning command line, I hope to create a bootable Linux distro and work off of that. Ideally I would like to create a partition on my hard drive, but I need to learn Bootable drives.</p> </div>

    <div class="headline"> I am a HUGE Nerd... </div>	
		<div class="contents"><p>And I do Nerd stuff like play Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and Magic The Gathering.  I might be <i>considerably</B></i> older than my counterparts, but I actually play in the NJIT DnD Guild. (Please dont judge me! I missed out on this in Undergrad)  </p> </div>

		 <div class="headline"> I Drive ALOT</div>	
		<div class="contents"><p>No really, I do. This is my 2010 Hyundai Elantra purchased brand new. This is the last odometer reading I took. Her name is 'Asha' which means 'Hope' in Hindi. I named her this in "hopes" that she would cost less to maintain than my previous 2005 Chevy Cobalt. The naming convention worked. Aside of self inflicted injuries, I've only had 3 small repairs.   </p> </div>
